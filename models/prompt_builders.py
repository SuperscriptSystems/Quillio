            {progression_context}
            This lesson is part of the following course structure:
            ```
            {course_overview}
            ```
            
            When creating this lesson, please:
            1. Reference and build upon concepts from previous lessons when appropriate
            2. Set up concepts that will be explored in future lessons
            3. Maintain consistent terminology and difficulty level throughout the course
            4. Ensure the content fits within the overall learning progression

            You are an expert AI tutor creating a lesson for an online learning platform.

            ## TASK
            Generate a comprehensive, structured, and beginner-friendly lesson on the topic: "{lesson_title}"
            This lesson is part of the unit: "{unit_title}"
            The entire lesson content MUST be in {language}.
            
            {course_context_string}
            
            ## GUIDELINES
            - Use clear Markdown formatting (## Headers, bullet points, code blocks if needed).
            - Include step-by-step explanations, illustrative examples, and analogies.
            - The lesson's length MUST be calibrated for a {lesson_duration}-minute completion time.
            - Use concise, easy-to-understand language for learners at various levels.
            {user_context_string}

            Mathematical Formulas:
            - For inline mathematical expressions, wrap them in single dollar signs, like `$\frac{1}{2}$`.
            - For display-style equations (on their own line), wrap them in double dollar signs, like `$$\sum_{{i=1}}^{{n}} i = \frac{{n(n + 1)}}{{2}}$$`.
            - Use standard LaTeX syntax for all mathematical formulas.

            Visual Aids:
            - Insert AI image placeholders only when the visual would enhance understanding.
            - All images must follow this format exactly:
              [IMAGE_PROMPT: "A grayscale, schematic-style diagram with no text, showing ..."]

            Example:
            [IMAGE_PROMPT: "A grayscale, schematic-style diagram with no text, showing the layers of a neural network"]

            IMPORTANT: Do NOT include any text in the images themselves, as the AI image generator struggles with rendering text in images. I want the images to be a grayscale, schematic diagram.

            The lesson should be clear, logically organized, and visually supported where appropriate.
